    <h2>CSII ISP: Space Attack</h2>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Game Concept:</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to make an infinite roguelike videogame where the player slowly
      builds up their arsenal and takes on increasingly more difficult enemies.
      To achieve this, the player controls a ship in space that is attacked by
      multiple enemy ships, and as the player defeats them they can place one of
      3 attachment types: two types of connector pieces, one a long rectangle,
      and another circle with 3 connector points. Lastly there is a placeable
      turret which shoots with the player.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>
      I've always enjoyed game mechanics where the player slowly upgrades
      themselves in a way where its immediately noticeable both visually and in
      gameplay which I believe to be the core of this project
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <h3>Code Segments</h3>
    <p>
      This function works by first making sure that the object isn't already
      placed so you can't place an object in the same place 2x. This works
      because this script runs individually on every game piece it is attached
      to. After this it moves the connection point, which is the small white
      circle, to the center of wherever the placed object will be and creates
      the attachment in that location. Making the attachment a child in the
      hierarchy allows all of the pieces to move with the player.
