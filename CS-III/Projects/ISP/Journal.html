    <h2> Week of 13-Feb-2023 </h2>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto"> Technical Challenges: This week my teammates and I were able to develop a minimum viable product with two pages. My teammate created the look and UI of the website and I was tasked with creating functionality. To accomplish this I created an array of objects that contain an id, description of the issue, who it's assigned to, and the priority level. Initially, I didn’t think through how our app was structured which led me to creating the array in the add issue page function. This made it impossible to pass the data to the issue viewer page since they were both on the same level in the hierarchy and weren’t connected. I solved this by initializing the array one level higher in the app function which loads both pages. Since both pages are called in this function I was able to push the array into both pages as parameters and have it persist. 
    </p>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto">  Scheduling Challenges: Overall, I was able to dedicate most of my time this week to working on the ISP. The main scheduling challenge I had was half of the features for the add issue page such as choosing priority and assigning the issue, were non functional on wednesday. Luckily I wasn’t called on to present on that day and by Friday everything was functioning and I was able to present a fully working website.
    </p>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto">  Interpersonal Challenges: One of my team members made the initial start of the website which massively helped the look of our website as I am much more comfortable working on functionality rather than UI. The strong base they made massively helps keep a unified look going forward. We didn’t have many interpersonal challenges for the presentation however I found that some of the info added was very “word-count-filler” where it either said nothing or wasn’t very helpful at making a point. For my presentation I just removed the slides and went into further detail while speaking.
    </p>


    <h2>Week of 6-Feb-2023    </h2>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto"> Technical challenges: We started the beginning of our project using node and react. This includes two pages where you can add issues and track your created issues. The functionality has not been developed yet, however the UI is done. One of the challenges we’ve encountered is whether to push a config file created by node called package-lock.json. It helps keep track of node versions and packages used. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto"> Scheduling challenges: There were few scheduling challenges this week.There were some issues the ice week made many of us behind in our classes and now these classes are scrambling to regain their footing by compressing due dates. Overall, everyone knew what they needed to be doing and was able to continue working on their part. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto"> Interpersonal challenges: We haven’t had any interpersonal challenges, we are mostly working on our own components which hasn’t allowed for any interpersonal issues to arise. Everyone is on track and working at the right pace.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Week of 23-Jan-2023</h2>

    <p class="center" style="margin:auto"> Technical challenges: This week was focused on learning SQL since it was required for the course, however, it’s also something that I would like to integrate into our project. We focused on learning commands for navigating through SQL databases, so I’ll have to learn how to create my own database on my own time as well as how to use it with NodeJS.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto">Scheduling challenges: This was the first week that my classes started ramping up as most of my classes had either a test or project, or both for some. I haven’t had as much time to focus on the project, however coincidentally, the subject we went over in class helped me further my project so we’re still on a good path. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin:auto">Interpersonal challenges: Overall, although we’ve all had a busy week as many of us have similar course loads, we’ve been able to avoid any large challenges. Everyone seems to still be keeping up with learning their specific roles and technologies. 
    </p>
    <br>


    <h2>Week of 16-Jan-2023</h2>

    <p class="center" style="margin: auto">Technical challenges: I have experience in front end web development due to the scheduler app I worked on in CSII and this portfolio, so I began working on backend this week. I started with nodeJS. As I got further into learning node, I started to realize that I would need a lot more than just node and a front end in order to get the website working. I started to realize that I hadn’t yet thought through the full tech stack that was necessary. One of these choices got a lot simpler after the end of this week where I was introduced to mySQL in class, and since I’ll be forced to learn this in class, it will be easy to use in my project while also helping me get a better understanding of it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto">Scheduling challenges: While all of us are in different classes, we’re beginning to use discord to communicate with each other. We’re also all set up on github projects now giving us additional communication options especially if none of us can get together at the same time to talk. Overall, we’re making progress and becoming more comfortable communicating.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto">Interpersonal challenges: We’ve still not had any interpersonal challenges yet, however I predict that we might have issues with github and source control. I prefer to take advantage of multiple branches which could cause issues with integration later down the line if merged improperly. However, so far everyone is working hard on planning the project and focusing on their respective roles.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Week of 09-Jan-2023</h2>

    <p class="center" style="margin: auto;"> Technical challenges: I was unable to make an SSH key for my personal computer which would let me make changes to the repository. In the end I was able to use Github Desktop to authenticate for me and allow me to edit the repository. Github projects is a very counter intuitive system for organization. It’s set up with all the ISP’s from every student in the same project which makes it cultured. I’m sure as I use the app more I’ll get used to it.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto;"> Scheduling challenges: Due to all three of us being in different class periods for CS, we’re unable to collaborate during class time. This forces us to discuss the project outside of school hours. So far we have a group chat which helps us communicate, as well as github issues being great at organized discussions on specific topics.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto;"> Interpersonal challenges: Overall we had a low amount of challenges as we all know each other and our capabilities. We also haven’t started developing any major project systems yet, so we agree on theory so far. Time management will be difficult for all of us as we all take advanced courses, however I’m confident that as long as everyone makes this a priority we will do well together.
    </p>

    <h2>Week of 02-Jan-2023:</h2>

    <h3>Development Engineer:</h3>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto">The development engineer is responsible for coding the application. This means that they will have the most direct influence on the implementation. This is the most time consuming role as features will need to constantly be added, removed, and revised with the development engineer receiving criticism from almost every other role. I am suitable for this role because I am willing to put in the required hours in order to ensure that we meet deadlines as well as learning NodeJS which will be what we use to develop our website. A challenge I expect to encounter will be meeting deadlines which will require long hours on those days in order to meet them. Other challenges will mostly be technical challenges which I plan to overcome through research and careful planning.

    </p>

    <h3>QA Engineer</h3>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto">The QA engineers review the code to ensure it meets quality standards. Also ensures that code works in all use cases. They work closely with development engineers in order to help build up a strong codebase which will be reliable and scalable. I am suitable for this role due to my strong problem solving skills and attention to detail helping me debug software. On top of this, I have strong communication skills which helps when giving suggestions to teammates. Challenges I expect to encounter are frustration when working on a single bug for a long period of time. I plan on overcoming this by taking a short break in order to look at the issue with fresh eyes. Another challenge is, as the project progresses and becomes larger, knowledge of all the components will be essential to debugging parts of it. I plan to overcome this by staying on top of everything that is made, including those made by team members. 
    </p>

    <h3>Project Manager:</h3>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto"> The project manager oversees what everyone is doing and what features are being worked on by each team member. This role needs a strong vision of the project just like the product manager however with the added responsibility of understanding what team members can do and in what time period. This role will also need to keep the product manager realistic in their expectations if necessary such as what features can be added and the overall scope of the project. I am suitable for this role because I am comfortable with creating detailed planners while simultaneously understanding that flexibility is sometimes required. A challenge I expect to encounter will be finding times where all team members can be present at the same time. Since I am in a separate class period than my team members there might be issues finding time to meet up. I plan on overcoming this by communicating online which will give us a much more flexible amount of time to communicate.
    </p>

    <h3>Product Manager:</h3>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto"> Oversees what features will be implemented and gives a general idea of when they should be done. This is the high level research and planning that will be necessary in order to give the team the broad idea of what the project will become.I am suitable for this role because I have a very strong vision of what this project should be and know the technologies we need to use in order to meet this vision. My knowledge in coding will also help set realistic roadmaps for the team. One challenge I might face is the inevitable necessity to choose when a feature needs to be removed due to not meeting expectations or no longer being needed. I plan on overcoming this by discussing this with my team members and communicating my reasoning for my decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>Release Engineer:</h3>
    <p class="center" style="margin: auto"> The release engineer determines everything from how the software is stored to build rules and guidelines, as well as final deployment. For this project, the most important and frequently used part of this role will be source control such as how the github is organized as well as being in charge of major merges. I am suitable for this role due to my experience and comfort in using git source control. One challenge of this role is the technical challenge of source control ensuring the correct code is used and nothing necessary is overwritten. This is overcome through experience and research over various git commands and their functions, and at the end, everything is stored and can be reverted. A major challenge of this role is the necessary communication with every other role because a chosen branch strategy must be agreed upon and understood by everyone.
