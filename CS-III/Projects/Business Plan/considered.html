      <h1>Considered Proposals</h1>

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/zoe-yau/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Available Tables</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">Available Tables is an app that will allow you to make reservations at any restaurant in a single convenient app. While this is a great idea in concept and very useful for its users, however I don’t believe that restaurants will allow this app to take orders for them. Restaurants want to incentivize as many users to use their website as possible as this allows the restaurant to advertise their meals and deals. </p>
    
      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/william-clymire/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Detect and Deter Drowsiness Detector (Dx3)
    </a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">This project uses facial recognition in order to detect when the target is falling asleep and then wake the user. While this is an interesting idea that I believe will be possible to complete, I don’t believe that it will be very useful. Any situation where it would be necessary to stay awake, such as driving,  is also a situation where you should just stop doing the activity while tired. </p>
      
      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shivangi-gupta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Castaway</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">This project is an app that helps create travel plans by giving users everything from flights to activities as well as giving time estimates. This is very useful as it helps people make easy travel plans without too much effort. However, I believe that in the end no matter how good a travel companion is, it won’t be as good as doing independent research of the area yourself. </p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jana-daouk/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">The Fit</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto"> The Fit is an app that creates an outfit for the user whenever they wish. While I can see this idea being useful for trying on clothes online or while shopping, I believe that it is impractical. Users simply will not want to nor have the motivation to update an app with every outfit in their closet as well as updating the app every time a piece of clothing is clean and then updating again when it's been washed. </p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/neeraj-gogate/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Coding Language Converter</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">This code converter is aiming to convert code written in one language into another language. The plan is to convert an interpreted language into a theoretically faster compiled language. While this seems like a good idea in theory, I don’t believe that it will be possible to create a converter that is efficient enough to make an interpreted language faster through an automated compiled language. This is already the job of the interpreter which I believe is already much more optimized than supported than any single project can be. </p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/myoram-langwang/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Project Bolt</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">Project Bolt is a communication tool for CS students in order to help them understand topics. I believe that this project is a chatroom and won’t have any call functionality, however, this is not clarified anywhere in the proposal. The business model is a monthly subscription with a free trial while simultaneously competing with Merlin Mavens, a free alternative. I believe that due to the difficulty in finding good tutors combined with the fact that this is a paid application competing with a free service (Merlin Mavens), it will not be able to convince a large enough user base to meet its goals.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/oliver-hankins/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Automatic Attendance Tracker</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">This project aims to automatically take attendance for teachers through facial recognition in class. While this is a great idea and would be very useful if possible, I believe that leaving such an important task to automation will cause many issues. Firstly, the small number of students who still wear masks would not be able to be properly checked. Another issue is where will the camera for this be located, if it’s outside by the hallway a student could simply put their face over the camera and then walk away, never actually attending class. On the other hand, if the camera is placed inside the classroom there will be privacy concerns as the facial recognition will not have the same level of security measures as a security camera. </p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/adheesh-katru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Automated Gardening</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">This project aims to use weather data as well as sensors in order to automatically cultivate the perfect garden through automated lighting and watering. This is a great idea as there are numerous weather API’s that can be used to gather weather information and automated watering and artificial lighting can realistically be set up mechanically. Overall, while I believe this is a very good project that is both impressive and feasible, I am personally not interested in working with plant life or working with physical parts at this moment. </p>

      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-bhuta/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Tempora</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">I believe that Tempora is the best video game concept that has been presented so far with the business proposal having a one and a half page script along with a very stylized website. This makes it obvious that the developer is working from a place of passion and I’m sure will make a great game. The only reason I am not choosing this project is because I worked on a video game for my ISP in my junior year and wish to develop something that is more useful and can be used to help solve a problem I have. </p>

      <h1>Chosen Proposal</h1>

      <h2><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/rafid-ahmed/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Bug Tracker</a></h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">This is the project I chose and is very similar to mine as it is a productivity tool that wishes to help developers keep track of their tasks to not fall behind or forget deadlines. I believe that this will be a useful tool that I can see myself using in the future in order to help me keep track of all of my assignments. Furthermore, I have personally been interested in gaining experience developing a database which will be necessary for this project to function properly. </p>
