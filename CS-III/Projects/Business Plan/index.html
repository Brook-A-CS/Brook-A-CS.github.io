      <h1>Organizer App</h1>

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <h2>Identity</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">The organizer app will be able to help users keep track of upcoming deadlines and events no matter how big or small through an easy to use website.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">In today's fast paced, interconnected world, it’s very easy to forget upcoming dates for even the most important events, and with the increased frequency of online commitments such as online classes, an important date could easily be missed.</p>


      <h2>Solution</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">This organizer app will have two main viewing modes which will be a calendar view with each date being expandable as well as a card view which shows all tasks in order of when they are due with tasks past due being highlighted. Users will also be able to set repeating tasks in a large assortment of options such as picking weekdays or setting a custom interval such as every other day. These options will also be able to be mixed which will allow, for example, a repeating task on only every other day excluding weekends. </p>


      <h2>Target Market</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">While this app will work for anyone, it is targeted to schools and teachers who wish to help both themselves and their students become better organized.  </p>


      <h2>Competition</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">There are many organization tools already developed, however most mobile apps have intrusive ads that disrupt the user experience while ours will be ad free. Bigger companies such as Microsoft and Google have their own ad free planner as well, however these collect a large amount of personal data in return for being ad free which some users have a problem with and will set us apart with our project being open source with no data collection.</p>


      <h2>Revenue Streams</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">The organizer app will have a premium subscription model which will be targeted at businesses using it for employees, however it will be free for personal use. Due to this project needing minimal development after the initial completion, a large revenue stream will not be necessary.</p>


      <h2>Marketing Activities</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">The app will be targeted at administrators and teachers who are much more likely to be responsible and want an organization tool. Targeting administrators as they also helps with marketing to teenagers and young adults, who are a notoriously difficult demographic to advertise to, as the administrators promote the application for no cost.</p>


      <h2>Expenses</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">The largest and constant expense will be the hosting web servers both the website itself and the database. Due to the nature of the application once development is complete, there will not be a need for many updates which will keep development costs low.</p>


      <h2>Team and Key Roles</h2>

      <p class="center" style="margin: auto">Currently the only member of the team is me, Brook Asnake, however there is room for many developers who wish to work on either the website’s backend, frontend, or both. Furthermore, anyone who wishes to develop a mobile application using the same backend database is welcome to join, however, there are no current plans for a mobile application. The website will be developed through the React JS, however this is subject to change after consultation with team members and in depth research.</p>
