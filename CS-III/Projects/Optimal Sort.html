    <p class="center" style="margin: auto"> The time complexity, most of the time, for all three is O(n<sup>2</sup>), which is why all 3 sorting algorithms have very similar times with one exception.  O(n<sup>2</sup>) means that every sorting algorithm can be represented by a polynomial with ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c, with the a, b, and c values differing due to the sorting method of each algorithm. The one exception that was mentioned earlier is an ordered file which is only O(n) for bubble sort and insertion sort making it significantly faster than the selection sort which is still O(n<sup>2</sup>). Since bubble sort works by looping through the words until it doesnâ€™t have to make any switches, it only has to iterate through the word list once, making it very fast. Insertion sort also only has to iterate through the file once since no element will have to be checked multiple times. Lastly, selection sort will always look for the lowest, then second lowest, ect, meaning that whether the file is ordered or not, it will iterate through the file the same amount of time, making it much slower at ordered lists than the other two sorting algorithms.
