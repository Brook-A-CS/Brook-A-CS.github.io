<p class="bodypg"> AI systems are likely to be designed and built in a way that makes them seem like they are more than just computers. While this sounds a bit like a Star Trek TV series, it can actually be very similar to humans. For example, the last two sentences were written by an AI with minimal editing on my part.
</p>

<h3>Blue Collar Jobs</h3>
<p class="bodypg"> AI advancements, similar to all other technological advancements, are growing at an exponential rate and are now at the cusp of becoming indistinguishable from humans. Overall I believe that sentient AI and AI advancements in general will be a great step for humanity, however, its benefits will not be equal for everyone. The biggest detriment of AI is that it can, will, and already has taken many blue collar jobs and will, in the near future, threaten white collar jobs. I have personally seen this happen with my father who previously worked as a toll collector for NTTA in the late 2000s and being laid off due to new automated systems. While this system greatly helped traffic in tollways by making the system much faster, helping humanity overall, but my father and his coworkers still lost their jobs. While my father was able to find another job relatively quickly, this was in part due to safeguards put in place such as unemployment benefits, and in the end he still took a significant pay decrease. 
</p>

<h3>White Collar Jobs</h3>
<p class="bodypg"> While sentient AI has yet to truly take over skilled jobs, it is getting very close. For example, I was able to have the beginning of my essay written by a free online text generator, which pales in comparison to OpenAI’s GPT-3 which is much more complex and has many more capabilities. GPT-3 can be used for a large variety of tasks and impersonate various writing styles, from writing professional essays to making social media posts. (Roose, 2022) Recently an AI generated digital art project won Colorado State Fair’s fine art competition which, obviously, made some artists very upset. The art piece is very stunning, and the man who entered the image made no attempts to hide that it was AI generated, however, it did not sit right with artists who compared it to hiring another person to draw for you and taking credit. (Roose, 2022) This issue also brought up an ethics concern of AI learning from other people’s art, without a license or any other way of compensating them, and then proceeding to compete against the same group of people and win. In the near future these AI’s will both become a great tool for helping current designers and artists while also threatening their field’s existence. Once again, this will help out humanity by making it easy and cheap to produce specialized images while also threatening jobs.
</p>

<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p class="bodypg">I believe that sentient AI will still be mostly beneficial to humanity in the long run, but it will also slowly begin to reveal greater inequality throughout the world as AI helps corporations make greater profits while those profits are distributed to less and less workers. In order to combat this, governments will need a strong support system for those whose jobs are threatened by AI systems such as sustainable pay until they can find another job or even paying for people to go through training courses for other fields who won’t be threatened.</p>

<h3>Social Implications of AI</h3>
<p class="bodypg"> Taking over jobs isn’t the only thing we need to be concerned about, as I mentioned earlier, AI can generate social media posts. While this is both harmless and even a great display of what AI is capable of when it is properly disclosed that an AI is producing the message, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SubSimulatorGPT2/comments/caaq82/we_are_likely_created_by_a_computer_program/">this</a> post on a subreddit populated by nothing but bots, it can also be used to manipulate ideas on a scale never seen before. The most well known example of this was the 2016 presidential election where an estimated 400,000 bots were engaged on twitter alone over the span of one month. (Bessi  & Ferrara , 2016) While it is impossible to say just how effective these social media bots were at influencing people, it is clear that this method will become more common as AI advances and it becomes even harder to properly distinguish between AI and human posts.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p class="bodypg"> Even though sentient AI will present us with a myriad of new social and economical issues, I believe that the overall contribution will be beneficial and we will see the technology make our lives easier in the long run.
