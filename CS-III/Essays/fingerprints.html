      Internet security revolves around HTTPS, which has slowly become the
      standard to help protect users. The two primary purposes of a HTTPS
      connection are to enhance the user’s security and privacy through sending
      the website data through a type of connection called Secure Sockets Layer
      (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). Both SSL and TLS describe the
      same process of an encrypted connection that cannot be broken. At first,
      HTTPS was expensive and therefore used sparingly, however as it became
      cheaper over time, many websites began to use it for the whole website.
      This has caused issues with institutions who wish to see what users are
      doing on their computers. These include the government, such as the FBI,
      as well as private employers and schools who have had a harder time
      monitoring those they oversee. To get around these security measures, they
      use an HTTPS Proxy Appliance to create man in the middle attacks. These
      proxies impersonate Certificate Authorities (CA). Certificate Authorities
      check if a website is who it says it is, after sufficient evidence such as
      physical address, public phone numbers, etc. (Gibson, 2013) After they
      receive sufficient information, a CA will sign off the website’s security
      certificate. In order to monitor a user, an institution will impersonate a
      CA through an HTTPS Proxy Appliance, after that, The Proxy Appliance will
      be the “man in the middle” and connect the website to the user through its
      own servers. After this point, the owner of the Proxy has access to every
      way the user interacts with the website and can log everything for a
      complete history of everything the user has done, or it can enforce
      whatever policies it chooses such as content filters for certain words.

    <h3>SSL Interception</h3>
    <p>
      SSL interception cannot be prevented, however you can still keep yourself
      protected. The first thing you must do is determine whether or not you are
      being intercepted, which can easily be done in any modern browser. I will
      only mention how to do it in Chrome, however the process is similar in
      other browsers. First you need to find the fingerprint value of a website
      on your network, to do this: Navigate to the padlock at the left-end of
      the URL bar, click it, then click “Connection is secure,” after this click
      “Certificate is valid,” which will open a menu. This menu is determined by
      the operating system you are running, however in Windows, you need to
      navigate to the details tab, then scroll to the bottom where it says
      Thumbprint and click it. This will display the hexadecimal
      fingerprint/thumbprint value. Now you must compare this to the same site’s
      fingerprint on another network. While this can be done physically by going
      to another network (such as your home network instead of a school/work
      one) it is easier and more convenient to use this site (gcr.com) which
      will get the fingerprint of a website through its own servers. If the
      fingerprint on your personal browser, and the one found on this website
      match, it means that your network does not have any SSL interception. If
      this site ever goes down, or its integrity is ever in question, you will
      have to find a second network to test on, but keep in mind that if the
      fingerprints do not match, you will have to consider whether the original
      network you tested or the secondary one is the one being injected.
    </p>
    <h3>Hashing</h3>
    <p>
      The fingerprint you see here is just a number in hexadecimal format. This
      is called a hash; a hash is created by taking all of the data within a
      file (in this case the website) and running it through an algorithm until
      it comes out to, usually, a hexadecimal value with a fixed length. A good
      hash algorithm, such as SHA-3 is developed so that when anything in the
      original file changes, down to as small as a single bit, it will create a
      “snowball effect,” where the hash will be significantly different.
      (Gibson, 2013) A good hash will be easy to convert from a normal value
      into a hash value, however, it should be very difficult to take the hash
      value and create the original file. (Schneier, 2004) As technology and
      computing power improves older hashes will become easy and quick to decode
      which will lead to the creation of new hashing algorithms, however just as
      computing power increases exponentially, so do new hashing algorithms.
    </p>
    <h3>False Positives/Negatives</h3>
    <p>
      This method of detection is not fool-proof and a matching/mis-matching
      fingerprint might have other explanations. Very large websites, such as
      Google, Youtube, Amazon, etc, might have multiple fingerprints depending
      on your location in order to load the webpage as fast, therefore,
      mis-matching fingerprints could just mean that your location and grc.com
      have different certificates which are closest to it. To get around this
      you should try multiple websites and attempt on smaller websites (such as
      gcr.com itself). False mis-matches are not the only issue, there can also
      be matching fingerprints even if you are being SSL intercepted. This can
      occur because whoever is doing the intercepting has blacklisted whatever
      site you are using to test the fingerprint. This means they will not know
      what you are doing on that specific website; however, all other websites
      are still vulnerable. (Gibson, 2013) The best way to get around this is,
      once again, to test multiple websites, however make sure to try and stick
      to small websites.
    </p>
    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p>
      My personal belief on whether schools, governments, ISP’s, or employers
      should have the right to eavesdrop on you is that they should not be able
      to, however with certain exceptions. Schools, workplaces, and ISP’s should
      never be able to spy on you, because any spying they do will be to further
      themselves and not the general public, therefore it is not fair to expect
      people to give up a significant part of their privacy in order to benefit
      another entity. The government however should have the ability to begin
      eavesdropping on you through a warrant, just like any physical area you
      own. This will allow government institutions to strike a balance between
      protecting people's freedoms and protecting people’s wellbeing. This
      stance brings up the argument that, in order for a government to spy on
      its citizens after a warrant, it will have to develop and maintain the
      ability to spy on its citizens at all times which can easily be abused.
      While it does mean that the government can spy on its citizens at any
      point as long as it is not caught, and let's be honest even if/when it is
      caught nothing will change, I still believe that this is the best possible
      compromise since almost every government in the world has the ability to
      track its citizens online, and so it is unrealistic to expect any of them
      to reduce this ability. Expecting them to suddenly stop having the ability
      to spy on its citizens would be equivalent to asking a nation that has
      developed nuclear weapons to stop production and disarm all of their
      current ones, which is safe to say impossible.
