    <p class="bodypg"> Humans are all subject to biases and prejudices impacting our decision-making process. While this can sometimes be obvious, it is much more likely that the person in question can only identify their own biases with sufficient reflection. I will reflect on how I came to the conclusion of choosing my ISP project as well as making decisions for my ISP and reflect on how much biases influenced my choice. Although it will be impossible to overcome all biases, reflecting on them will help me become a better decision-maker by making me aware of my biases, which will help me overcome them. 
    </p>

    <h3>Escalation</h3>
    <p class="bodypg"> Escalation, more commonly known as sunk cost fallacy, is the tendency to continue pursuing a course of action even when it is no longer in our best interest, simply because we have already invested significant time and effort. (Arnott, 1998) This is another common bias that can see us taking more significant losses in the long run rather than a minor upset in the present. In the case of our ISP, as we learn more about the technologies we use, we will improve our abilities, and issues with earlier parts of the project will start showing. For a specific example, fixing an earlier part of the code base may help more than forcing every future aspect to work around the earlier weaknesses. We intend to overcome this by leaving the last month before our ISP is due for bug fixes and overall improvements and implementing buffer periods in our schedules to account for unforeseen delays. This will give us enough time to fix earlier parts and take unexpected delays.
    </p>

    <h3>Confirmation Bias</h3>
    <p class="bodypg"> The bias I am most susceptible to is confirmation bias. Confirmation bias is the tendency to seek information that confirms existing beliefs and biases while ignoring or dismissing information that challenges those beliefs. (Arnott, 1998) Even as I was going through the business proposal picking process, I had the mindset that any other project idea would have to beat the bug tracker. To overcome this bias, I will be open-minded and receptive to new ideas and consider alternative proposals' potential merits.
    </p>

    <h3>Loss Aversion</h3>
    <p class="bodypg"> Loss aversion bias is the tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring gains. (Kahneman et al., 1991) During the business proposal acceptance process, I tended to sway towards proposals that incorporated technologies and languages I had learned before or had experience with. For example, many of my most seriously considered proposals and my eventual chosen project were websites, which I had experience with due to the scheduler project from computer science II. To overcome this bias, I will focus on the potential gains of a decision rather than the potential losses of not being able to complete the project. By overcoming this bias, I will become a more well-rounded programmer as I will base my decisions on what I believe will be the best solution rather than just what I believe I can do. 
    </p>

    <h3>Anchoring</h3>
    <p class="bodypg">Anchoring bias occurs when individuals rely too heavily on a single piece of information, usually the first piece of information given, when making decisions. (Arnott, 1998) In the case of the ISP, my team and I must ensure that we give equal consideration to opposing ideas. For example, when choosing the technologies we use, such as possible javascript frameworks and back-end solutions, we need to consider that we will have a subconscious bias toward the first solution we have. This can be overcome by first acknowledging and attempting to counteract the bias and by thinking about significant decisions over multiple days, which will help diminish the effect of the anchoring bias.
    </p>

    <h3>Overconfidence</h3>
    <p class="bodypg"> While overconfidence might not be thought of as a bias initially, overconfidence can easily hurt long-term decisions and planning. Overconfidence can lead to unrealistic expectations and goals, resulting in disappointment and frustration when those expectations are not met. (Arnott, 1998) It can also lead to a lack of thoroughness and attention to detail and lead to underestimating the complexity of the challenges we will face. This can result in mistakes and oversights that can have costly and time-consuming consequences. In addition, overconfidence can lead to a lack of humility and flexibility, making it challenging to adapt to changing circumstances or learn from failures, further complicated by the sunk cost fallacy. Specifically, overconfidence can lead to procrastination by underestimating the amount of time implementing features will take and undervaluing other team members' input. To overcome this bias, I will take a more self-reflective approach to decision-making and ensure I give every idea the consideration it deserves. As for the time estimates being affected, we have accounted for this by implementing buffer gaps in our schedule for delays and other large-scale issues.
