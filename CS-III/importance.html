        This digital portfolio is important to me because it is a personalized way I can show my growth as a developer and the variety of technologies I have used and become accustomed to throughout the projects I have worked on. This creative approach to show my projects and accomplishments allows for an easy and always available way to show anyone what I have worked on throughout High school and hopefully beyond and is a great way to make a strong first impression. 
      </p>
      <p class="bodypg">
        A digital portfolio is also a great organizational tool throughout my learning where I can quickly and easily go back and see the path I have taken, which will help guide me in the future. The portfolio is also a great motivational tool where I want to show my best work which will help push me to work harder on each new project. Developing this long term project also gives me experience on working on something over a long period of time and allows me to plan ahead to combat any potential issues I might have. This will demonstrate the benefit of coding for the long term and not taking easy shortcuts since I know I will eventually have to go back. I know that spending sufficient time on a part of this website now will help save me time in the future. Overall, I wish to look back over this website for the next couple of years and see how I have improved both through the projects and the website itself and see tangible growth.
