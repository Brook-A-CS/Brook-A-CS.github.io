    <h1>About me</h1>

    <h3>introduction</h3>

    <p class="bodypg">
      Hello, my name is Brook Asnake and I am currently a high school senior in my third year of my school's computer science STEM pathway, and am looking at taking my first step into my developer career. I had a strong interest in technology from a young age and have enjoyed spending time on the computer, which eventually led to me developing an interest in computer parts and software which led to me taking Computer Science in sophomore year. I have an especially strong interest in technology that can make everyday life easier and open opportunities. 
    </p>

    <h3>CSI</h3>
    <p class="bodypg">
      During my first year of CS, the most important thing I learned was how to navigate through bash through the CLI on a ssh server we had access to where I learned basic computer science principles and basics. 
    </p>

    <h3>CSII: Sudoku</h3>
    <p class="bodypg">
      The second year of CS was much more project based and I created a <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISDClassroom/sudoku2-jager-acog-1"> sudoku game</a> through a swift library. This was my first group project where I worked with multiple people and used source control with other contributors which taught me basic git commands and how to resolve merge conflicts. This project was also my first introduction to object oriented programming which I would continue to use in future personal projects. 
    </p>

    <h3>CSII: Course Planner</h3>
    <p class="bodypg">
      The next project was a website that would function as a <a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISDClassroom/scheduling-app-view-certifiedboylovers">course planner</a> for students taking classes the next year. It was the first time I dealt with serious front end web development. This project was also a group project, however it was with 13 people now which brought up much larger source control issues. We had to plan our branching strategy which boiled down to any large changes being done in another new or existing branch and, after discussion, being merged to main. In the end this project taught me website design, UI/UX, and, most importantly, the process behind developing for a client which gave a lot more freedom compared to assignment, while also coming with the drawbacks of clients changing requirements throughout as their vision changed. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>CSII: Unity Game</h3>
    <p class="bodypg">
      For the final project of the year, I decided to develop a <a href="./Projects/2021Final.html">2D video game</a> using Unity game engine along with three of my classmates. Throughout this project I learned C# and how to use the numerous Unity tools in order to create the best game I could. It was an excellent experience where for the first time I had complete creative control over what was developed. I also gained insight on what it was like overseeing a project and deciding what features were worth developing and what needed to be cut. 
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p class="bodypg">
      Overall, throughout my CS journey, I have gained experience in a variety of programming languages such as Javascript, Swift, Python, C#, and C++. I have also worked with a team on a large scale project and am comfortable with version control and bash commands. I am constantly looking to build experience and learn new skills and have a strong passion for learning.
