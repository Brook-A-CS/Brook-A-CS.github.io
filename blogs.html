    <h3>BYOD</h3>
    <p>
        AllenISD has implemented an excellent new system where every student has the ability to rent a chromebook for free, or buy $20 insurance. This excellent for students as it gives everyone an opportunity to have access to technology whose use has skyrocketed following COVID. However, AllenISD has now decided to move on to another policy. The following school year, 2023-2024, AllenISD will remove the BYOD and guest wifi options for students and have another, chromebook only wifi network, effectively forcing students to only be able to use chromebooks while at school. Chromebooks were great when they were an option for disadvantaged students, however it will now become a requirement. This is awful for a large number of students, however I will focus on something that I have personal experience in. Throughout my highschool years, I have taken a verity of STEAM classes and while I did not have a personal device for all of these courses, a personal device would be useful in each of them.
